|                | React hooks               | Vue3 Composition API  | 备注               |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 状态           | `useState` `useReducer`   | `reactive` `ref`      | -                  |
| 引用           | `useRef`                  | `ref`                 | 不单指引用组件实例 |
| Context        | `useContext`              | `provider` `inject`   | -                  |
| Effect / Watch | `useEffect`               | `watchEffect` `watch` | React 手动指定依赖 |
| 缓存           | `useMemo` `useCallback`   | `computed`            | React 机制决定     |
| DOM            | `useLayoutEffect`         | `nextTick`            | -                  |
| 使用规则       | **组件内** & **顶层作用域** | 任意                  | -                  |
